When submitting issues on GitHub, please include as much detail as possible to make debugging quick and easy. good - Your versions of js-data, js-data-redis, etc., relevant console logs/error, code examples that revealed the issue better - A plnkr, fiddle, or bin that demonstrates the issue best - A Pull Request that fixes the issue, including test coverage for the issue and the fix Github Issues. Submitting Pull Requests Contribute to the issue/discussion that is the reason you'll be developing in the first place Fork js-data-redis git clone git@github.com:&lt;you&gt;/js-data-redis.git cd js-data-redis; npm install; Write your code, including relevant documentation and tests Run npm test (build and test) You need io.js or Node 4.x that includes generator support without a flag Your code will be linted and checked for formatting, the tests will be run The dist/ folder &amp; files will be generated, do NOT commit dist/*! They will be committed when a release is cut. Submit your PR and we'll review! Thanks! Have write access?Here's how to make a release on the master branch: Bump package.json to the appropriate version. npm test must succeed. This time, the built dist/js-data-redis.js file will be committed, so stage its changes. Mention the release version in the commit message, e.g. Stable Version 1.2.3 Push to master. Create a git tag. Name it the version of the release, e.g. 1.2.3 Easiest way is to just create a GitHub Release, which will create the tag for you. Name the Release and the git tag the same thing. git fetch origin if you tagged it via GitHub Release, so you can get the tag on your local machine. npm publish .
